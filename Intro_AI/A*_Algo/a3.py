# Problem 1 - Fringe Expansion
#################################
# Objective:
# 1) Write a function that adds the possible states that we can get to
#    from the current state to the end of the fringe.
#
# Notes:
# (1) This function should not return or yield anything but just update the contents of the fringe
# (2) board.slide_blank is error-safe. It will return None if it is impossible to slide the blank

#################################
# Objectives:
# (1) Write a function that takes current_board and goal_board as arguments and

#     Your heuristic must be admissible (never overestimate cost to goal), but
#     it does not have to be consistent (never overestimate step costs).
#
# Notes:
# (1) This heuristic should be admissible, but greater than (closer to the real
#     value than) the manhattan distance heuristic on average. That makes it a
#     better heuristic.
